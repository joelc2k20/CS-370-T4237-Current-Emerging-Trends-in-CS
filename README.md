#Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

I was given a lot of the code as a template for myself. The only thing I was tasked to create was the Q-train and Q-alogrithm so that the game can have an adversary. I was able to do this and it was pretty difficult, but it did work in the end.

#What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

In terms of connecting this to the larger field of computer science, this code is an example of a simple algorithm that performs a basic arithmetic operation. Computer scientists develop algorithms like this to solve problems across a wide range of domains, from finance to healthcare to transportation and beyond.

#How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Approaching a problem as a computer scientist typically involves breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, identifying the data inputs and outputs, and designing an algorithm that can process the data inputs to produce the desired outputs.

#What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As a computer scientist, you have ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization. This includes ensuring the security and privacy of user data, designing systems that are accessible to all users, and being transparent about the limitations and potential biases of your algorithms. Additionally, you should consider the potential societal impacts of your work, including issues related to fairness, accountability, and transparency.
